  <h2>A Guide for Picking the Right Food for your Dog:</h2>
  <p>When choosing which food to buy, you’ll want to understand the nutritional needs of your dog and how they may differ from other dogs. If you have a new puppy you’ll need food specifically formulated for young, growing pups. Or if you have a dog on the small or large end of the spectrum there will be a specific formula more suited to your dog’s needs.

  <h2>A Guide for Picking the Right Food for your Cats:</h2>
  <p>The quality and safety of the food you select is of utmost importance. Select a brand that sets extremely high quality and safety standards for their food and all of their partners. A manufacturing facility that undergoes inspection by government officials and third party auditors means that it meets very high standards of sanitation, cleanliness and good manufacturing practices. When it comes to ingredients, select foods that have their ingredients sourced from trusted partners as close to the manufacturing facility as possible. This ensures freshness and reduces the environmental impact from transportation. Whole food ingredients, like fresh meats, fruits, and vegetables, provide the essential nutrients, antioxidants and plant-based nutrients to support optimal health. Look for foods which are naturally preserved. It is also important to select a food that has detailed nutrient information readily available.

  <h2>"Adopt, Don't Shop"</h2>
<p>
<strong>1.)</strong> You’ll save a life – or two! Currently, more than 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year. This number would be dramatically reduced with an increase in adoptions. Every time an animal gets adopted, that frees up kennel space for another homeless animal to find their fur-ever home!
<br>
<strong>2.)</strong> You’ll save money Adoption fees are generally well below the price that breeders charge to buy a pet. Plus, most shelters and rescue groups provide microchipping and spaying/neutering before adoption, so you won’t have to pay for those services out of pocket.
<br>
<strong>3.)</strong> Lots of adoptable pets are already trained When you adopt a pet, it’s common that they have already lived in a home at some point and may know basic commands before they even meet you! Not only does this save you money on a trainer, think of how cool you’ll be when your friends come over and see Spot put on a show. (Is your Wonderpup still learning? Try Wondercide Organic Treats – the perfect treat for training!)
<br>
<strong>4.)</strong> The choices are endless Want a big pet, small pet, tall pet, short pet? Long hair, short hair, no hair, curly hair? Young, senior, hyper, calm? You’re certain to find a pet perfect for your personality and situation!
<br>
<strong>5.)</strong>  The love is unconditional The utter adoration your pet will have for you will never cease to amaze you. There’s this special bond when you’ve rescued your pet and offered a true fur-ever home. And who doesn’t love to come home to someone every day who’s just over the moon to see you? So go ahead…”Adopt Don’t Shop!”
